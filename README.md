# Unhandled Exception in DApp Arithmetic Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in decentralized applications (DApps): unhandled exceptions. The provided JavaScript code contains a `divide` function that throws an error when dividing by zero.  This lack of proper error handling can lead to application crashes and a poor user experience.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents a solution that addresses the unhandled exception using a `try...catch` block.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run the `bug.js` file using Node.js ( `node bug.js` ).  Observe the unhandled exception.
4. Run the `bugSolution.js` file using Node.js ( `node bugSolution.js` ). Observe the improved error handling.

## Importance of Robust Error Handling in DApps

Robust error handling is paramount for DApp development.  Unhandled exceptions can disrupt functionality, lead to data loss, and create security vulnerabilities.  Implementing comprehensive error handling mechanisms, such as `try...catch` blocks and logging, is crucial for creating reliable and secure DApps.
